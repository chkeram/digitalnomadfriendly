## Custom Functions

### find_venues_within_radius
```sql
SELECT * FROM find_venues_within_radius(37.7749, -122.4194, 5.0);
```
Finds venues within a specified radius (km) of given coordinates.

### get_venue_recommendations
```sql
SELECT * FROM get_venue_recommendations('user-uuid', 37.7749, -122.4194, 10.0);
```
Returns personalized venue recommendations based on user preferences and location.

## Usage Examples

### Finding Nearby Venues
```sql
-- Find venues within 2km of downtown San Francisco
SELECT v.name, v.address, 
       ROUND(ST_Distance(v.location, ST_MakePoint(-122.4194, 37.7749)::geography) / 1000, 2) as distance_km
FROM venues v
WHERE ST_DWithin(v.location, ST_MakePoint(-122.4194, 37.7749)::geography, 2000)
  AND v.status = 'active'
ORDER BY v.location <-> ST_MakePoint(-122.4194, 37.7749)::geography;
```

### Venue Search with Filters
```sql
-- Find quiet venues with good WiFi and outdoor seating
SELECT v.name, v.overall_rating, va.wifi_quality, va.noise_level
FROM venues v
JOIN venue_amenities va ON v.id = va.venue_id
WHERE v.status = 'active'
  AND va.wifi_quality >= 4
  AND va.noise_level <= 2
  AND va.outdoor_seating = true;
```

### User's Favorite Venues
```sql
-- Get user's favorite venues with details
SELECT v.name, v.address, f.personal_notes, f.list_name
FROM favorites f
JOIN venues v ON f.venue_id = v.id
WHERE f.user_id = 'user-uuid'
ORDER BY f.created_at DESC;
```

## üåç PostGIS Geospatial Features

### Location Storage

Venues store location data as PostGIS GEOGRAPHY points:

```sql
-- Location stored as longitude, latitude (SRID 4326)
location GEOGRAPHY(POINT, 4326) NOT NULL
```

### Key Spatial Functions

#### find_venues_within_radius
Find venues within a specified distance from a point.

```sql
SELECT * FROM find_venues_within_radius(
    37.7749,    -- center latitude
    -122.4194,  -- center longitude
    5.0         -- radius in kilometers
);

-- Returns: venue_id, venue_name, venue_address, distance_km, overall_rating, total_reviews
```

#### get_venue_recommendations
Get personalized venue recommendations based on user preferences.

```sql
SELECT * FROM get_venue_recommendations(
    'user-uuid',  -- user ID for personalization
    37.7749,      -- center latitude
    -122.4194,    -- center longitude
    10.0          -- search radius in kilometers
);

-- Returns: venue_id, venue_name, distance_km, overall_rating, compatibility_score
```

## üîí Row Level Security (RLS)

All tables have RLS enabled with comprehensive policies:

- **User Data**: Users can only access their own profiles and data
- **Venue Access**: Anyone can view active venues, authenticated users can create
- **Review System**: Users can create/edit their own reviews, all can read public reviews
- **Favorites**: Strictly personal, users can only access their own favorites

## ‚ö° Performance Optimization

### Strategic Indexing

```sql
-- Geospatial index for location queries
CREATE INDEX idx_venues_location ON venues USING GIST(location);

-- Composite indexes for common queries
CREATE INDEX idx_venues_status_rating ON venues(status, overall_rating DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_reviews_venue_date ON reviews(venue_id, created_at DESC);
```

## üîß Development Workflow

### Local Development

1. **Make Schema Changes**: Edit migration files in `migrations/`
2. **Test Locally**: Run `npm run db:setup` to test changes
3. **Update Types**: Sync TypeScript types in `src/lib/types/database.ts`
4. **Add Sample Data**: Update `seed/sample_data.sql` if needed
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Run test suite and manual tests
6. **Document Changes**: Update this README with new features

### Migration Management

```bash
# Create new migration (manual)
touch database/migrations/002_add_new_feature.sql

# Apply all migrations
npm run db:setup

# Reset database for clean testing
npm run db:reset
```

## üß™ Testing and Validation

### Schema Testing
Run comprehensive tests with `test_schema.sql`:

```bash
# Copy test_schema.sql to Supabase SQL Editor and run
# Or use psql directly:
psql $DATABASE_URL -f database/test_schema.sql
```

### Test Categories
1. **Table Structure**: Verify all tables and columns exist
2. **PostGIS Functions**: Test spatial operations
3. **Sample Data**: Validate data insertion and relationships
4. **Geospatial Queries**: Test location-based functions
5. **Aggregate Functions**: Verify triggers work correctly
6. **Data Integrity**: Check for orphaned records

### Manual Testing Queries

```sql
-- Verify PostGIS is working
SELECT PostGIS_Version();

-- Test venue search
SELECT * FROM find_venues_within_radius(37.7749, -122.4194, 5.0);

-- Check data integrity
SELECT table_name, column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
ORDER BY table_name, ordinal_position;
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**PostGIS not available**
- Enable PostGIS extension in Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Extensions

**RLS policy blocking queries**
- Check authentication state: `SELECT auth.uid(), auth.role()`
- Verify policy conditions match your use case

**Slow spatial queries**
- Ensure spatial index exists: `CREATE INDEX idx_venues_location ON venues USING GIST(location)`
- Use `ST_DWithin` for radius filtering before expensive calculations

### Debug Commands

```sql
-- Check current auth context
SELECT auth.uid() as user_id, auth.role() as role;

-- List all policies
SELECT tablename, policyname, cmd, qual 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public';

-- Check index usage
SELECT schemaname, tablename, indexname, idx_scan, idx_tup_read
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
ORDER BY idx_tup_read DESC;
```
